      	<h3>I love stories.</h3>

			<p>I’ve always loved stories. I remember my dad taking my sister and I to a drive-in theater on Friday nights for a horror movie double feature. We were way too young for a lot that
			was happening on that big screen, and the sound, whether it be on the radio or through those ancient speakers next to each parking spot, was always horrible. But I loved it. Watching movies there was one
of my favorite early memories.</p>

			<p>I knew from a pretty early age that I wanted to be a storyteller. I wanted to be a writer. I wanted to be a filmmaker. I wanted to be a journalist. I wanted to do everything at once. I tried on a lot
of different creative hats.</p>

			<p>I earned  my bachelor’s degree  in journalism from  the University of  Houston and worked  as a reporter for about two years before I burned out. There are only so many &quot;kid-dies-in-fill-in-the-blank-accident&quot; stories you can do before it gets to you.</p>
	
			<p>I decided to go back to collage. I attended a semester of film school at Houston Community College. I loved talking film with people who loved movies as much as I did. I had the opportunity to write and direct a couple of short films. During the summer I even got to work on the set of a low-budget western, setting up lights and occasionally electrocuting myself. The days were long, the pay was non-existent and by the end of the shoot my feet were a mess. And, yes, I loved every minute of it. (The movie is on NetFlix, and it’s much worst than I could have imagined.)</p>

			<h3>Design is storytelling.</h3>

			<p>I had to leave school and go back to work. I worked menial jobs trying to get myself back on my feet. It was during this time that I decided that I needed to use my degree. I earned a part-time job at Houston Community College’s Coleman College for Health Sciences as a public relations assistant.</p>

			<p>Along with writing, design became an important part of my job. I wanted the designs I created to be more powerful. I began talking to our students about why they choose our school and their profession. I spoke to faculty and staff about their programs and what challenges their students faced. I used all this information to create more thoughtful designs and a brand for our college.</p>

			<p>I soon realized that I was doing what I had always wanted to do: I was telling stories. I learned that every line and shape had a meaning. Design wasn’t just pretty images. It had the power to create
strong emotions, just like a movie. Design could inform, just like a book. Good design made the world a clearer place for people, and bad design could confuse and frustrate.</p>

	  <p>I am a storyteller. Design is my medium.</p>
