    <h2>HCC Coleman College's The Book</h2>

	<p>The Book gives potential HCC Coleman College students a rundown of all the programs the college offers and what steps they need to take to start their healthcare career. Itâ€™s also visually pleasing. Filled with vivid colors and photography, The Book provides potential students a well-rounded vision of HCC Coleman College.</p>
    
    <p>I was in charge of guiding this project from the inital idea all the way to it's completion. I communicated with our departments to ensure that all of the information listed in The Book was accurate and timely. I worked with our graphic designer to outline the catolog's organization. I supervised several versions of the layout until the Public Relations Director was pleased with the direction we were going. I wrote and edited copy. I took and edited photographs. I supervised the design of The Book. I submitted the final project to our printer and tracked it until it was delivered to our campus.</p>
    
    <p>The HCC Coleman College Public Relations Department was awarded a 2012 Gold Paragon award in Academic Catalog design from the National Council for Marketing and Public Relations (NCMPR).</p>
